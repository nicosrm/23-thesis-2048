### üïπÔ∏è The Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer [Gabriele Cirulli](https://gabrielecirulli.com). The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.


### üöÇ Motivation

After watching a series of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSn-DJU8qf0) on how to implement the 2048 game in JavaScript with P5, I got the inspiration to do the same with SwiftUI and Combine. So some of the logics behind matrices manipulation I borrowed from Mr. [Daniel Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman) *(Keep inspiring people with your videos <3)*.
